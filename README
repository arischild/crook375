 Input file format: first line contains the value of n for the n x n the grid, followed by  the sudoku itself,
 with each value separated by a space, and each row seperated by a new line. blank spaces are represented as 0.
Example input file:
 4
 0 2 0 4
 4 1 2 0
 0 4 0 0
 0 0 4 0

 Acceptable values of n must have a natural number square root. Program assumes 
 proper input. For now only 4x4's and 9x9's work properly. 16x16's work theoretically, 
 but take too long in execution to actually test.

 This program assumes correct input, including a solvable sudoku. If the sudoku is not solvable, a segfault may occur.

 Command line format: ./crook <input file name> <algorithm name>
   <algorithm name> is either "simple" or "crooks"

 Example command line: ./crook sudoku.txt simple
